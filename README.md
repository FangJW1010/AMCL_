# AMCL
Supervised contrastive learning with hard sample mining for multi-functional therapeutic peptide prediction
##  Introduction
we propose AMCL, an innovative framework for MTP prediction with several key contributions.  
(1) We introduce a novel semantic-preserving data augmentation strategy that integrates back-translation substitution, sequence reversal, and random replacement of similar amino acids. This strategy expands the dataset while effectively preserving the structural integrity of peptide sequences;   
(2) By combining multi-label supervised contrastive learning with hard sample mining, our framework adaptively focuses on difficult samples. This enhances feature learning and boosting the model's discriminative power across functional categories;  
(3) We propose a weighted combined loss that combines Focal Dice Loss (FDL) and Distribution-Balanced Loss (DBL). This strategy mitigates class imbalance and enhancing both model performance and generalization capabilities;  
(4) We introduce a category-adaptive threshold selection mechanism that assigns independent decision thresholds for each functional category, enhancing prediction accuracy and reliability. Experimental results demonstrate that AMCL significantly outperforms existing methods, achieving notable improvements across multiple evaluation metrics.  

The framework of the PSCFA method for MFTP prediction is described as follows:
